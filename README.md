# Data Warehouse Assignment

In this repo, you can find three dirs:

## Part 1: Writing
This directory includes two files with PDF and DOC file formats answering the writing two questions.

## Part 2: Coding
This directory includes the following files:
- `script.sql`: The SQL scripts used to build the tables `session_events` and `screen_flows`, as well as the `INSERT` query to generate the coding task.
- `dataset.py`: A script written in Python 3 to generate random data sets. To run this script you simply do `python3 dataset.py` and a data set `output-<epoch-timestamp>.csv` will be generated to be used as a test for `script.sql`.
- Three data set samples `output-<epoch-timestamp>.csv` generated by `dataset.py`.

## Part 1: Design
This directory includes two files with PDF and DOC file formats answering the design question.
